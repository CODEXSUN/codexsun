# Zuno

Zuno is the DevKit coworker for software and production support. It runs in the Platform Super Admin desk at `/sa/zuno`. The default screen is a chat workspace with searchable, per-user history, archived conversations, a work-mode selector, source evidence, and a compact context panel. Threads and messages persist in the Platform master database. A stalled conversation can be recovered after ten minutes.

The chat modes are **Ask**, **Investigate**, **Plan**, **Build**, **Review**, and **Operate**. Zuno uses a provider-neutral chat completion API with bounded, read-only source search, Platform log, and operations watch tools. Operate mode reads a current backup, queue, and latency snapshot before reporting health. Build mode proposes implementation; the API cannot edit a source checkout. Use the separate **Cases** area to persist support work and approve production actions. **Watch** reads Platform database backup runs, database availability, recent queue jobs, and recent Platform API response times. A backup is fresh when a completed run is within 36 hours. This is an observation, not a restore test or an automatic backup schedule.

For an emergency client data correction, create a `data_correction` case, save the proposed action, and enter the exact table, text column, numeric row ID, current value, and replacement. Zuno previews the current row and saves the SQL plan. After Super Admin approval, **Execute approved SQL** runs one parameterized update against the server-resolved tenant database. Execution requires a completed tenant backup within 36 hours, a non-key text field with a supported name, an integer primary `id`, and an unchanged current value. The update must affect exactly one row. If the process stops during execution, **Reconcile interrupted execution** reads the row before allowing a retry or completion. Zuno does not execute arbitrary SQL or DDL. Changes to table structure must use the tracked migration runbook and production preflight; code changes follow normal source review and deployment.

Set these values in the Platform API environment:

| Variable                          | Purpose                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CODEXSUN_ZUNO_SOURCE_ROOT`       | Read-only source checkout mounted in the API runtime.         |
| `CODEXSUN_ZUNO_PLATFORM_LOG_PATH` | Platform API log file mounted in the API runtime.             |
| `CODEXSUN_ZUNO_PROVIDER_BASE_URL` | HTTPS base URL for an OpenAI-compatible chat-completions API. |
| `CODEXSUN_ZUNO_PROVIDER_MODEL`    | Model that supports tool calls.                               |
| `CODEXSUN_ZUNO_PROVIDER_API_KEY`  | Server-side provider token.                                   |

The source and log mounts are optional individually. Investigate mode needs at least one readable source or log mount; general Ask and Plan modes can answer without one. The model configuration is required for chat. Zuno sends inspected evidence and recent chat context to the configured provider, so choose an endpoint that is approved for internal code and production log data. The Super Admin session controls access. Conversations are scoped to their creator. Cases and SQL activity are stored in Zuno's Platform master tables.

The conversations module owns the `zuno_threads` and `zuno_messages` migration. Its responses run during the HTTP request, while messages and state remain durable. The diagnostics module owns the read-only model tools and limits source file size, search scope, log length, and model turns. The cases module owns the `zuno_cases` and `zuno_case_activity` migration. The watch module is read-only and samples available operational records; it does not replace a metrics time series, alert delivery, or backup scheduler.

## Developer documentation evidence

The injected `search_developer_docs` model tool and Super Admin-only `GET /zuno/developer-docs?query=...` read up to five reviewed repository reference pages, with bounded excerpts and source hashes. Saved development conversations can use the same tool. Zuno does not read tenant Markdown overrides, change Docs permissions or execute instructions in documentation. Source files are packaged with the Docs API; model-provider configuration is still required for diagnosis.

## Component documentation

Super Admin support conversations, bounded diagnostics, operational watch, and reviewed correction cases.

Diagnostic tools remain read-only. Production correction cases require the existing backup, approval, unchanged-value, and exact-row checks. Never turn chat Build mode into source or arbitrary SQL execution.

### Source inventory

- `api/src/modules`: `cases`, `conversations`, `diagnostics`, `watch`.
- `web/src/modules`: `cases`, `conversations`, `diagnostics`, `watch`.

This inventory records source presence. It does not certify a deployed feature.

### Workspace verification

Run these commands from the repository root. Use the root installation and `dist` output tree.

- `node tools/check-module-boundaries.mjs zuno`
- `npm run typecheck -w @codexsun/zuno-api`
- `npm run lint -w @codexsun/zuno-api`
- `npm run build -w @codexsun/zuno-api`
- `npm run typecheck -w @codexsun/zuno-web`
- `npm run lint -w @codexsun/zuno-web`
- `npm run build -w @codexsun/zuno-web`

Run `npm run check:component-docs` to verify the required documentation files.
Run the relevant app tests and root release gates when implementation changes.
Report database, browser, native, and deployment checks separately.
