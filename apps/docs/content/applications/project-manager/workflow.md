# Project Manager: workflow

## Supported sequence

1. Inspect platform, group and module registry hierarchy.
2. Maintain module metadata and documentation in the registry owner.
3. Capture and track implementation ideas.
4. Use registry records as operational metadata; executable application modules remain source-owned.

## Failure and access handling

Authentication, tenant scope, app activation and owner permission checks apply at the owning API. Preserve validation errors, missing-parent responses, duplicate policy, inactive states and audit. A provider/source configuration can change the workflow; confirm its live owner contract.

## Developer change workflow

1. Read the app guide and the owning module page.
2. Trace route → service → repository and frontend gateway → hooks → workspace.
3. Change the owning entity and its public consumers together.
4. Add a new immutable migration step for an applied schema change.
5. Run boundary, TypeScript, lint, build and affected database/browser tests from the root.
6. Refresh reference facts when source contracts change.
